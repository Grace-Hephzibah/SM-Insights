# SM-Insights
SM-Insights is a Social Media Clustering Dashboard which is a Python-based project that aims to analyze and visualize social media data 
to identify clusters of similar performing posts. This project is particularly useful for understanding patterns and trends in social media engagement.

## Usage
1. **Data Analysis:** Start by exploring the ```Notebook.ipynb``` notebook. This notebook walks you through the process of loading data, preprocessing, and applying the clustering algorithm.
2. **Running the Dashboard:** Execute ```app.py``` to launch the Dash web application. This will start a local server where you can interact with the visualizations.

## Features 
- **Data Analysis:** Utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and hypothesis testing.
- **Clustering Algorithm:** Implements a K-Means clustering algorithm to group similar social media posts.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Offers a Dash-based web application for interactive visualization of clustering results.
